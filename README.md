# C-fundamentals-course
I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science from the University of Punjab in Lahore. In the second semester, I took a course on Programming Fundamentals (C language) with Professor Abdul Mateen. In this course, I covered C fundamentals, including Input/Output, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, bits manipulation, loops (for, while, do-while), arrays (1D, 2D, and 3D), functions, file handling, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

In this repository, you will find my class codes, practice questions, assignments, and practice lab materials.

Happy Coding!
